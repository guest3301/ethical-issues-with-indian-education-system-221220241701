### Areas of Improvement in Your Blog Post

1. **Lack of Data and Statistics**:  
   Your post would benefit significantly from incorporating quantitative data, such as statistics on literacy rates, student enrollment, dropout rates, teacher-student ratios, or digital access. These would substantiate your claims and make your arguments more compelling.

2. **Comparison with Global Education Systems**:  
   Adding comparisons with other education systems, especially in countries with successful policies, can provide context and highlight areas where India lags.

3. **Highlighting the NEP's Impact with Case Studies**:  
   Mention specific examples of schools or regions where NEP 2020 initiatives have succeeded or failed. Case studies would make the discussion more relatable and grounded.

4. **Visual Aids and Infographics**:  
   Including graphs, charts, or images showing the rural-urban divide, teacher training statistics, or mental health issues among students would enhance engagement and clarity.

5. **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
   Provide actionable solutions or policy recommendations to address the ethical challenges you’ve identified. This would add depth to your critical analysis.

6. **More Focus on Implementation Challenges**:  
   Delve deeper into the issues of governance, funding, and monitoring that hinder NEP 2020’s execution.
