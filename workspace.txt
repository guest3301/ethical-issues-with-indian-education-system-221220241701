**3. The Pressure on Students: Mental Health Crisis**

<p>The weight of academic success in India often feels like a Sisyphean task for students. High-stakes exams such as IIT-JEE and NEET dominate the narrative, pushing students into a cycle of stress and anxiety. The result? A growing mental health crisis, with **nearly two-thirds (63.5%)** of senior high school students in Kolkata reporting stress due to academic pressure according to a study in 2015 [1].  A more recent 2024 NCRB report reveals a worrying surge in student suicides over the last ten years, with a fifty percent increase in male student suicides and a sixty-one percent increase in female student suicides [2]. This indicates that the problem hasn't improved despite the implementation of NEP 2020 [2].

Here's a deeper look into the factors contributing to this crisis and the ineffectiveness of the implemented solutions:

* **High Expectations from Parents and Society:** A lot of youngsters feel pressured to live up to social norms and their parents' aspirations. This pressure to excel can be immense, leading to significant stress and anxiety [2].

* **Competitive Exams:** Board exams, JEE, NEET, and other entrance exams are extremely competitive and act as entry points to esteemed universities. The pressure to achieve high rankings to secure a seat in these universities can cause anxiety and sleepless nights [2].

* **Lack of Improvement in Mental Health Services in Schools:**  While NEP 2020 acknowledges the importance of mental health, its implementation regarding equipping schools with trained counselors to provide students with essential emotional support has been sporadic [2].

These persistent stressors can have detrimental effects on students' mental health, including:

* **Anxiety and Panic Attacks**
* **Depression**
* **Burnout**
* **Low Self-Esteem**
