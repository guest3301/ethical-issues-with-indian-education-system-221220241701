        <h2>Introduction: Unveiling Ethical Challenges in India’s Education System</h2>
        <p>India’s education system, despite its massive scale, grapples with several deep-rooted ethical issues that
            hinder the growth and potential of its students. In an attempt to address these concerns, the National
            Education Policy (NEP) 2020 was introduced. Its vision was to create a more inclusive, accessible, and
            holistic educational framework for India’s diverse student population. However, in its implementation,
            several ethical dilemmas have emerged—ranging from socioeconomic inequalities to challenges in the policy's
            true reach and accessibility.</p>

        <h2>1. Socioeconomic Disparities and Unequal Access to Education</h2>
        <p>While education is a fundamental right, it is not always accessible equally to all children. The rural-urban
            divide, caste-based inequalities, and economic disparities continue to marginalize large segments of the
            population. NEP 2020 aims to bridge this gap by emphasizing a ‘universal access to education,’ particularly
            in rural and underserved areas. However, the actual allocation of resources to these regions remains
            minimal.</p>

        <h2>2. Teacher Training and Quality of Education</h2>
        <p>Teachers in many regions are underpaid and undertrained, and the curriculum often focuses more on
            memorization than fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. NEP 2020 addresses
            this concern but requires better implementation to improve teacher training and reduce absenteeism.</p>

        <h2>3. The Pressure on Students: Mental Health Crisis</h2>
        <p>The intense pressure placed on students to perform academically has led to rising mental health issues. NEP
            2020 suggests integrating counseling and well-being programs into schools, but the absence of real mental
            health resources in rural areas highlights the gap between policy and practice.</p>

        <h2>4. Inclusivity: Education for All or Education for the Few?</h2>
        <p>NEP 2020 proposes universal access and inclusivity but lacks clear strategies for overcoming entrenched
            social barriers. Schools in India still lack facilities and trained educators for children with special
            needs, and gender and caste-based biases continue to affect access to education.</p>

        <h2>The Vision of NEP 2020: Reforms for the Future</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Holistic, multidisciplinary education</li>
            <li>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)</li>
            <li>Increased focus on vocational education</li>
            <li>Integration of technology</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges in Implementing NEP 2020: A Critical Review</h2>
        <p>While NEP 2020’s intentions are laudable, its success depends on overcoming significant structural and
            implementation hurdles. The rural-urban divide, lack of digital infrastructure, and decentralized approach
            pose major challenges.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Moving Forward with NEP 2020</h2>
        <p>India's education system, with its complex web of ethical challenges, stands at a crossroads. NEP 2020
            presents a vision of a more inclusive, equitable, and holistic educational framework, but its success
            depends on overcoming significant structural and implementation hurdles.</p>
